# List of Ports to be Familiar With

Here's a list of standard ports you should see at least once. You **shouldn't remember them** (the exam will not test you on that), but you should be able to **differentiate between an Important Port (e.g., HTTPS - port 443) and a database port (e.g., PostgreSQL - port 5432)**.

## Important Ports

| Service | Port |
|---------|------|
| FTP     | 21   |
| SSH     | 22   |
| SFTP    | 22 (same as SSH) |
| HTTP    | 80   |
| HTTPS   | 443  |

## RDS Database Ports

| Database         | Port  |
|------------------|-------|
| PostgreSQL       | 5432  |
| MySQL            | 3306  |
| Oracle RDS       | 1521  |
| MSSQL Server     | 1433  |
| MariaDB          | 3306 (same as MySQL) |
| Aurora           | 5432 (if PostgreSQL compatible) or 3306 (if MySQL compatible) |

> **Don't stress out on remembering these!**  
> Just read this list once today and once before going into the exam and you should be all set :)

**Remember:**  
You should just be able to differentiate an "Important Port" vs an "RDS database Port".
