In the next lecture, when doing the hands-on you will realize a new encryption option is available, named DSSE-KMS and released in June 2023.



DSSE-KMS is just "double encryption based on KMS".



As long as it is not coming up in the exam, I will not teach it in this course. If you do see it at your exam as an option, please let me know and I will update the course.



Happy learning!
